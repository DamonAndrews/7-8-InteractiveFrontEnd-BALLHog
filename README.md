I love javascript 

Hi team! 

Title: BallHog

Project Description: Users can select up to 20 NBA players to compare key stats. Search criteria includes position, points, rebounds and/or assists per game. As a bonus feature users will also be provided a link to any recent news for a player, if any are availble.

User Story: Jordan played in the IsaBallers league for years, but never made it to the playoffs. That all changed when he became a BallHog. By staying on top of player stats, schedules and breaking news, Jordan now can always make the game-winning decisions, and strikes fear into the heart of his league. 

    From Jordan: As an avid, fantasy basketball fan, and now reigning champion (thanks BallHog!), I need every tool at my disposal to WIN. staying up to date on the status of each player is crucial to identifying my best options. BallHog allows me the ability to stay one step ahead of the competition, by providing instantaneous updates for players by position and performance.
