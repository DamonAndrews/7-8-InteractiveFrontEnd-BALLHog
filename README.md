Hi team! 

Title: BallHog

Project Description: Users can select up to 20 NBA players to compare key stats. Search criteria includes position, points, rebounds and/or assists per game. As a bonus feature users will also be provided a link to any recent news for a player, if any are availble.

User Story: Jordan played in the IsaBallers league for years, but never made it to the playoffs. That all changed when he became a BallHog. By staying on top of player stats, schedules and breaking news, Jordan now can always make the game-winning decisions, and strikes fear into the heart of his league. 

    From Jordan: As an avid, fantasy basketball fan, and now reigning champion (thanks BallHog!), I need every tool at my disposal to WIN. staying up to date on the status of each player is crucial to identifying my best options. BallHog allows me the ability to stay one step ahead of the competition, by providing instantaneous updates for players by position and performance.
                                                                               -Jordan
Interactive Front-End Project
Projects are extremely important on your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you get further along in the boot camp, you’ll find opportunities to apply for web developer roles. Among the first requirements you’ll need to even get an interview are high-quality deployed examples of your work featured in your portfolio.

This project will be a centerpiece for your portfolio and your first opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities. Employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job. One of the requirements for this project is that you add it to your portfolio.

Project Requirements
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

Be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).

Use at least two server-side APIs.

Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

Be responsive.

Have a polished UI.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Finally, You must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.
