User Story: Jordan played in the IsaBallers league for years, but never made it to the playoffs. That all changed when he became a BallHog. By staying on top of player stats, schedules and breaking news, Jordan now can always make the game-winning decisions, and strikes fear into the heart of his league. 

From Jordan: "As an avid, fantasy basketball fan, and now reigning champion (thanks BallHog!), I need every tool at my disposal to WIN. staying up to date on the status of each player is crucial to identifying my best options. BallHog allows me the ability to stay one step ahead of the competition, by providing instantaneous updates for players by position and performance".
